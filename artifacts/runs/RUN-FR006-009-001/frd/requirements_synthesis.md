# Requirements Synthesis Export

Generated: 2025-09-17T04:15:00Z
Source Capture: RUN-BETA-001 selectors + observations

## Feature: Unified Dashboard Insights
- Story ID: STORY-FR-006-DASHBOARD
- User Story: As an operations lead, I want to view key performance indicators on the dashboard so that I can track account health in real time.
- Acceptance Criteria:
  1. When I open the dashboard, then the metrics header, revenue widget, and uptime status panel render together on first paint.
  2. When data is stale, then the dashboard shows an inline refresh toast with a "Retry" action.
- Traceability:
  - Page captures: selectors/index.json (dashboard), selectors/dashboard_selectors.json
  - Observations: selectors/dashboard_observations.txt

## Feature: Guided Login Experience
- Story ID: STORY-FR-006-LOGIN
- User Story: As a returning user, I want guided prompts through the login form so that I can authenticate quickly without errors.
- Acceptance Criteria:
  1. When a credential is missing, then inline validation appears beneath the corresponding field.
  2. When login succeeds, then the system records the session token and forwards to the dashboard without intermediate screens.
- Traceability:
  - Page captures: selectors/home_dom_snapshot.txt, selectors/home_selectors.json
  - Observations: tests/python/test_generated_suite.py::test_selector_candidates_exist

## Feature: Scenario Authoring Workspace
- Story ID: STORY-FR-006-SCENARIO-AUTHORING
- User Story: As a QA engineer, I want to export synthesized user stories with acceptance criteria so that I can hand off executable tests to automation immediately.
- Acceptance Criteria:
  1. When synthesis completes, then each captured feature produces a structured JSON entry containing story metadata and AC details.
  2. When AC quality checks run, then stories flagged for ambiguity are revised before export and marked with `quality_score` >= 0.8.
- Traceability:
  - Synthesis JSON: frd/stories_export.json
  - Quality review log: logs/story_quality_review.log

## Appendix: Data Sources
- Run inputs derived from RUN-BETA-001 selectors package.
- Generated artifacts persisted under artifacts/runs/RUN-FR006-009-001.
