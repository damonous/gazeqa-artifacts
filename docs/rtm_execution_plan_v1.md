## Operational Tracking
- Update docs/gaze_qa_checklist_v_4.json after each verification run with evidence bundle paths
- Capture run ids and artifact locations in observability dashboards for traceability
- Maintain weekly status review to unblock dependencies and monitor Done Definition metrics
- Track Done Definition KPIs explicitly: coverage_percent from FR-003/004 pipelines, story_to_test_coverage from FR-007 output manifests, and artifact upload success from FR-008 logs
- Alert on regressions when coverage or verification metrics fall below thresholds

## Next Steps
1. Assign engineering owners and target completion dates per FR
2. Stand up shared dashboard tracking RTM progress, checklist pass rate, and Done Definition KPIs
3. Integrate automated test execution into CI to continuously validate RTM coverage
